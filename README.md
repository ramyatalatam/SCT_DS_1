Task1 to visualize histogram on age distribution and bar plot on gender distribution

TASK 01 Completed: Visualizing Data from a CSV using Python!

As part of my Data Science learning path, I successfully completed Task 01 — generating visual insights from a real-world dataset in CSV format. This task introduced me to the core steps of importing, preparing, and visualizing data.

  Objective:
To explore and visualize key variables such as Age (a continuous variable) and Gender (a categorical variable) using plots like histograms and bar charts.


   Steps I Followed:

1. Dataset Collection:
I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle that included demographic details like Name, Age, and Gender.


2. Loading the Data:
The dataset was imported into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis and transformation.


3. Initial Data Review:
I examined the first few rows and checked for any missing or inconsistent data entries.


4. Data Cleaning:
Rows with null values in important columns (Age and Gender) were removed to ensure the visualizations were accurate.


5. Histogram Creation (Age):
I used a histogram to display how Age is distributed across the population — giving a clear picture of the age spread.


6. Bar Chart Creation (Gender):
A bar chart was plotted to compare the frequency of different gender categories, offering an easy view of gender proportions.


7. Insights & Interpretation:
These visuals helped me understand the gender distribution and identify dominant age groups in the dataset.


-->Tools & Libraries Used:

Pandas – For data manipulation and cleaning

Matplotlib – To build the histogram

Seaborn – For an enhanced and aesthetic bar chart

It was a great hands-on experience that strengthened my understanding of basic data visualization and EDA techniques!
